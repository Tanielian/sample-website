        <h1>Welcome my friends...</h1>
        <p>I am Taniel, a 22 years old IT student from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessab">KESSAB</a>, which is a wonderful village standing at the north-west part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria">SYRIA</a>.
I am a Syrian-Armenian citizen, like so many other Armenians that were born and have lived their entire life in Syria.</p> 
        <p>This small website, is written in <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/DEFAULT.asp">CSS</a>, and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp">HTML5</a>. 
Later, I will enhance the website, and support it with other Internet Programming Languages, and cool graphical features.The interesting thing in web designing is the variety of features and options. Web designers put their touch on the pages their design, whether their taste or their experiance.Speaking of myself, this is my very first Website...Congratulations to me. I tried so many outlooks and end up with the one you're looking at.As my first designing experiance, I tried to look at some CSS Templates like the ones in <a href="http://www.html5webtemplates.co.uk"> here</a>, to help me build my website...</p>
        <p> <span class="box">A little bit information about me..<br>I am an ambitious person with lots of dreams to achieve, and causes to support...Humanitarian causes for sure.
 I can speak 4 languages-Armenian, Arabic, English and French. My Passion is primerly music, as I am an ambitious singer, and Piano Player with composing and arranging capabilities. You can listen to my Cover song of Julio's "Nostalgie" <a href="art.html">here</a></br></span></p>
